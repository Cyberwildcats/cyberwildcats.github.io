Well, it's been a little while since our old Wordpress site went down and I stood up an emergency HTML page to provide the most minimal of websites, but at long last here is our new site!  This has been built using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  This new facility will be developed more over the days, weeks, and months ahead, but Cyberwildcats should find a good bit more use and facility in this new website.  If any Cyberwildcats have content to post or ideas of what should go up on this site, pleae give a shout out in the #website channel on our Slack!
