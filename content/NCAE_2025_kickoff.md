Calling all beginners!  The National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C) has announced their 2025 season for the [NCAE Cyber Games](https://www.ncaecybergames.org/#)!  For the past several years, the Wilmington University Cyberwildcats have competed in this excellent event for the benefit of our students.  This activity is much like the red-vs-blue cyber range events that we and Pros V Joes do, and is targetted for the absolute beginner.  In fact, they do not allow anyone who has competed in previous years to compete a second time.  

We will be fielding at least one team in this year's competition. To that end, we will be starting preparations immediately for the competetion that will be sometime in either February or March of 2025 (see their [event calendar](https://www.ncaecybergames.org/schedule#) for details)
