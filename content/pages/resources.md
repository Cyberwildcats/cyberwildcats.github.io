The Cyberwildcats have been around for almost 14 years now and in all that time weâ€™ve built up a considerable amount of resources for members to take advantage of in their journey to learn more about cybersecurity, hacking, and personal development. This is an overview of those resources to help club members find their way around.

## Cyberwildcats Slack

Even before its recent transition to an online only organization, the primary means of communication between Cyberwildcats club members has been via our Slack. All Cyberwildcats club members are invited to our workspace after acceptance into the organization.

## Google Group
</a>

While most Cyberwildcats communication happens via Slack (see above) sometimes an email is a more appropriate means of sharing information, ideas, and asking questions. The Cyberwildcats have long had a Google Group just for this purpose. All Cyberwildcats club members should be a part of the Google Group. If you are a club member and are not part of our Google Group, please contact the coach via Slack.

## Proxmox
</a>

The Cyberwildcats has several dedicated Proxmox clusters that club members can use for experimentation and learning.  This is also the environment where we run offensive-defensive exercises for students to benefit from hands-on cyber security experiences and tutelage from faculty and friends of Cyberwildcats, such as [Pros V Joes](http://www.prosversusjoes.net).  To request access, please post in the [Proxmox Support Channel on Cyberwildcats Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T09RD0WQM/C04HGQ5Q98F) to ask for access.  Make sure to include `@myssfit` and `@t3hc0ach` in your message.
