This presentation from August 2022 by The Coach  explains what Cyberwildcats is.  All Wilmington University students are welcome to join the club.  All Wilmington University alumni are equally invited to apply.  Those who aren't students or alumni are welcome to apply if they have a sponsor from Wilmington University, either student or faculty.  WilmU students and alumni are not required to provide a sponsor.
