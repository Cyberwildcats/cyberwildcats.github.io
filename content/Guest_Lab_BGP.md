As announced in our Slack space, our friend Warren from [Pros V Joes](http://www.prosversusjoes.net/) is back with hands on lab experience for the Cyberwildcats!  This tutorial will look at current tools/techniques, how rPKI is just a piece in the puzzle, and what we should do to secure the internet routing instead of waiting for an ideal solution that fixes all issues.

Learn step-by-step how to use FORT (an open-source RPKI Validator) and other open source software to validate routes. This virtual lab topology has been set up with one Linux machine, two Cisco Routers and one Juniper Router.

Hopefully the skills you will learn are:

- Deploying RPKI validators

- RTR configuration on routers

- Filtering with ROAs (Route Origin Validation)
