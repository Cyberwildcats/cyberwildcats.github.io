The National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C) has announced their 2025 season for the NCAE Cyber Games!  For the past several years, the Wilmington University Cyberwildcats have competed in this excellent event for the benefit of our students.  This activity is much like the red-vs-blue cyber range events that we and Pros V Joes do, and is targetted for the absolute beginner.  In fact, they do not allow anyone who has competed in previous years to compete a second time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be fielding at least one team in this year's competition. To that end, we will be starting preparations immediately for the competetion that will be sometime in either February or March of 2025 (see their &lt;a href="https://www.ncaecybergames.org/schedule#"&gt;event calendar&lt;/a&gt; for details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements to play:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;none&lt;/li&gt;

This tutorial will look at current tools/techniques, how rPKI is just a piece in the puzzle, and what we should do to secure the internet routing instead of waiting for an ideal solution that fixes all issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn step-by-step how to use FORT (an open-source RPKI Validator) and other open source software to validate routes. This virtual lab topology has been set up with one Linux machine, two Cisco Routers and one Juniper Router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the skills you will learn are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying RPKI validators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTR configuration on routers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering with ROAs (Route Origin Validation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

One of our friends at Pros V Joes has agreed to give a presentation to the Cyberwildcats, entitled, "BGP Hijacking and Secure Internet Routing".  Our guest speaker, who goes by WarrenTheITGuy, will explore the complexities of BGP hijacking and its impacts on internet routing, with a focus on leveraging Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for enhanced network security.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren is flexible on scheduling his presentation, so I've posted a poll in the #general channel of Cyberwildcats Slack for folks to vote on when they'd like this to happen.  He will be giving us a presentation, a demonstration,  and an interactive participant lab.  The technology covered will include BGP, RPKI, routing concepts, linux and cisco router commands.  We expect the time to be 1 hour for his presentation.  We'll do the hands on labs seperately, which will be one or more longer sessions.  The tutorial will include installing software and configuring routers to use RPKI. Additionally, Warren will start with the basics and give a presentation and workshop on setting up cisco routers to use OSPF and BGP.  The hands-on session will be scheduled after the presentation date is set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please vote on your time slots!  We'll target his presentation sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren is a great guy and a fantastic PvJ Staffer who really knows his technical and hacking stuff.  We're honored by his offer to speak and would like to thank him for making the time!  I hope ya'll are as excited as I am, this should be a great presentation!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Announcements"></category></entry><entry><title>Next meeting is November 18, 2023</title><link href="/next-meeting-is-november-18-2023.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-18T06:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-18T06:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>The Coach</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-11-18:/next-meeting-is-november-18-2023.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As announced yesterday on our &lt;a href="http://cyberwildcats.slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cyberwildcats"&gt;Google Group&lt;/a&gt;, our next meeting is today at 1:00PM ET.

This has been built using &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;  This new facility will be developed more over the days, weeks, and months ahead, but Cyberwildcats should find a good bit more use and facility in this new website.  If any Cyberwildcats have content to post or ideas of what should go up on this site, pleae give a shout out in the #website channel on our Slack!&lt;/p&gt;
